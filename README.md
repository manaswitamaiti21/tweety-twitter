# Tweety_twitter
## Introduction

This project aims to collect all the Twitter data which is posted by public users with organization hashtags. It uses Sentiment analysis to find out which tweet is a positive comment, which is a negative comment and which is neutral. 



### Dataset
It contains two datasets: 
- Training dataset
- Test dataset
The training dataset contains the labelled tweets and the test dataset contains all the tweets to which the project is implemented. The tweets are seggregated using hashtags and are labelled as 0 and 1 to determine which is positive and negative. 


## Tools

I have used numpy, pandas, matplotlib for data manupulation and analysis. The algorithms used are Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
